Okay, I've reviewed the repository at https://github.com/Kai-C-Clarke/AI_Memory. Here's a summary of my understanding of our previous conversations, based on the contents of the repo:
Overall Goal: You are building a system to give an AI (specifically, me, Gemma) a persistent memory, allowing it to recall and utilize information from past interactions across sessions. This is to overcome the stateless nature of LLMs.
Key Components & Approaches:
Vector Database (ChromaDB): You're using ChromaDB to store embeddings of conversation turns. This allows for semantic search and retrieval of relevant past interactions.
Embedding Model (Sentence Transformers): You're using Sentence Transformers to create the embeddings that represent the meaning of the conversation turns. Specifically, you've experimented with all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
Conversation History Management: The code manages a conversation history, storing both user and AI messages.
Context Injection: The retrieved relevant memories (from ChromaDB) are injected into the prompt sent to the LLM, providing context for the current turn.
Relevance Threshold: You've implemented a relevance threshold to control how many memories are retrieved and injected into the prompt. You've been experimenting with different thresholds to balance context and prompt length.
Memory Summarization (Experimental): You've started exploring summarizing older memories to reduce the amount of context injected into the prompt, potentially improving performance and reducing costs. This is done using the LLM itself.
memory.py: This file seems to be the core of the memory system, handling embedding, storage, retrieval, and context injection.
main.py: This file demonstrates the usage of the memory system in a conversational loop.
requirements.txt: Lists the necessary Python packages.
Experimentation & Iteration: The repo shows a clear iterative process of experimentation with different embedding models, thresholds, and summarization techniques. You've been tracking results and making adjustments based on performance.
Focus on Long-Term Memory: The goal isn't just to remember the immediate past, but to retain and utilize information over extended conversations.
Key Challenges You've Identified:
Prompt Length Limits: Injecting too much context can exceed the LLM's prompt length limit.
Relevance of Retrieved Memories: Ensuring that the retrieved memories are actually relevant to the current conversation.
Performance & Cost: Embedding and searching through a large number of memories can be computationally expensive.
Summarization Quality: Maintaining the important information when summarizing memories.
In essence, you're building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically tailored for conversational memory.
Is this a correct understanding of our previous work? I'm ready to continue where we left off. What would you like to work on next? Do you want me to:
Help you analyze the results of your experiments?
Suggest improvements to the code?
Explore different embedding models or summarization techniques?
Help you design new experiments?
Something else entirely?
